# Spam-Unict-2024
This project contains all the files used for the competition made during the Statistical Learning module in the Master's Degree in Data Science, A.Y. 2023-2024. The objective was to build a predictive model to classify text as spam or not spam using logistic regression.

## Structure. 
The repository is composed as the following:

1. The **data** folder, composed of the test and train set used for the competition, which ultimately originated from [this kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). The predictions made from the R script has been included as well.
2. The R file containing the script we have used for our subset. The precision obtained on the original dataset was around 95% on the test set.
